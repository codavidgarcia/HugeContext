    question: "How is HugeContext different from standard Vector RAG?",
    answer: "Standard RAG treats code as plain text snippets. HugeContext uses the **HugeContext Structural Engine** to build a multi-dimensional Knowledge Graph. It factors in AST relationships, PageRank-based importance, and Git history. This means your agent understands the 'why' and the 'how' across your entire architecture, not just keyword matches."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my code really 100% private?",
    answer: "Yes. Unlike cloud-based context engines, HugeContext performs indexing, embedding generation (via local Q8 models), and retrieval entirely on your local hardware. No code ever leaves your project directory."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I install the latest v2.0.1 version?",
    answer: "You can install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace or via terminal using `code --install-extension hugecontext-*.vsix`. Modern AI agents can also install it for you if you provide the command."
  },
  {
    question: "Which AI agents are compatible with HugeContext?",
    answer: "HugeContext is a native MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It integrates seamlessly with Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Antigravity, VS Code Copilot, and any other client that supports the MCP standard."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the core tools provided in v2.0.1?",
    answer: "HugeContext provides three specialized agent tools: `get_architecture_blueprint` for project-wide mapping, `query_codebase_graph` for deep semantic retrieval, and `find_implementation` for precision code extraction."
